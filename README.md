# Exercise 2 - Git &amp; Github

## Handeling conflicts

### Pull before Pushing

**All group members** should be sure to have an updated version of you project.    

**All group members** should then make a new file with a class in the project.    

**Group member 1** should ```` Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.    
**Group member 2** should ```` Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.    

You will get an error.    

**Group member 2** should do what the error message in the console tells you to and then ```` Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.     

**Group member 3** should ```` Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.    
You will also get the same error as number 2 did.    
**Group member 3** should do what the error message in the console tells you to and then ```` Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.    

**Group member 4** should ```` Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.    
You will also get the same error as number 2 and 3 did.    
**Group member 4** should do what the error message in the console tells you to and then ```` Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.

## Merge Conflicts
**Group member 3** should create a java file and call it RaceTrack.java, and then  ```` Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.
**All group members** should then pull the project.    

**All group members** should now create a method in the class and give it a unique name. member1Method(), member2Method() etc.    

**Group member 1** should ```` Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.    
**Group member 2** should ```` Add, commit and push ````. This will result in an error and it tells you to pull first before pushing. ````pull```` and then read the message in the console.    
There will be an error saying that there is a merge conflict and that it should be handled.
Group member 2 should now delete everything that he or she thinks should not be there or maybe keep everything if this is what he or she thinks is nice.  Remember that the non java signs

````     
  <<<<<<< HEAD
  
  =======
  
  >>>>>>> 79097c722cd99336061ca73d5ed209a159d9fd2b
````    
should be deleted no matter what. 
Then ````Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.      

**Group member 3** should ```` Add, commit and push ````. This will result in an error and it tells you to pull first before pushing. ````pull```` and then read the message in the console.

**Group member 3, 2 and 1** should now ````pull```` in the changes. Notice that since the merge conflicts already have been handled (in this case by group member 4) there is no merge conflicts, and it will be merged automatically (Fast-Forward).
