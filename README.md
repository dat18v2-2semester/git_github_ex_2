# Exercise 2 - Git &amp; Github

## Handeling conflicts

### Pull before Pushing

**All group members** should be sure to have an updated version of you project.    

**All group members** should then make a new file with a class in the project.    

**Group member 1** should ```` Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.    
**Group member 2** should ```` Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.    

You will get an error.    

**Group member 2** should do what the error message in the console tells you to and then ```` Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.     

**Group member 3** should ```` Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.    
You will also get the same error as number 2 did.    
**Group member 3** should do what the error message in the console tells you to and then ```` Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.    

**Group member 4** should ```` Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.    
You will also get the same error as number 2 and 3 did.    
**Group member 4** should do what the error message in the console tells you to and then ```` Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.

## Fast forward merging
**Group member 3** should create a java file and call it RaceTrack.java, and then  ```` Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.
**All group members** should then pull the project.    

**All group members** should now create a method in the class and give it a unique name. member1Method(), member2Method() etc.    

**Group member 1** should ```` Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.    
**Group member 2** should ````pull```` and then read the message in the console. It will tell you that it was merged using the Fast-Forward method.     
This means that git have detected that there is no problem in having both methods in the file and therefore it automatically merge the differences.     
Then ````Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.

**Group member 3** should ````pull```` and then read the message in the console. It will tell you that it was merged using the Fast-Forward method. Then ````Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.

**Group member 4** should ````pull```` and then read the message in the console. It will tell you that it was merged using the Fast-Forward method. Then ````Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.
