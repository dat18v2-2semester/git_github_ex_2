# Exercise 2 - Git &amp; Github

## Handeling conflicts

### Pull before Pushing

**All group members** should be sure to have an updated version of you project.    

**All group members** should then make a new file with a class in the project.    

**Group member 1** should ```` Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.    
**Group member 2** should ```` Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.    

You will get an error.    

**Group member 2** should do what the error message in the console tells you to and then ```` Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.     

**Group member 3** should ```` Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.    
You will also get the same error as number 2 did.    
**Group member 3** should do what the error message in the console tells you to and then ```` Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.    

**Group member 4** should ```` Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.    
You will also get the same error as number 2 and 3 did.    
**Group member 4** should do what the error message in the console tells you to and then ```` Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.

## Fast forward merging
**Group member 3** should create a java file and call it RaceTrack.java, and then  ```` Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.
**All group members** should then pull the project.    

**All group members** should now create a method in the class and give it a unique name. member1Method(), member2Method() etc.    

**Group member 1** should ```` Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.    
**Group member 2** should ````pull```` and then read the message in the console. It will tell you that it was merged using the Fast-Forward method.     
This means that git have detected that there is no problem in having both methods in the file and therefore it automatically merge the differences.     
Then ````Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.

**Group member 3** should ````pull```` and then read the message in the console. It will tell you that it was merged using the Fast-Forward method. Then ````Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.

**Group member 4** should ````pull```` and then read the message in the console. It will tell you that it was merged using the Fast-Forward method. Then ````Add, commit and push ```` the project to Github.


## Merge Conflicts
**All group members** should be sure to have an updated version of you project.    

**All group members** should now create an empty constructor in the RaceTrack.java file. In the constructor body all write a ````System.out.printline()```` printing out "hello from member1", "hello from member2" etc.    

**Group member 4** should ````Add, commit and push ````    
**Group member 3** should ````pull````    

There will be an error saying that there is a merge conflict and that it should be handled.    
**Group member 3** should now delete everything that he or she thinks should not be there or maybe keep everything if this is what he or she thinks is nice.  Remember that the non java signs ----------- HEAD ------------ ex. should be deleted no matter what. 
Then ````Add, commit and push ````.
